          <h3>Horsetail Falls</h3>
          <p>Horse tail falls is a beautiful waterfall in Alpine Utah! The hike gives you a unique look at the provo valley, a rather pretty on if I do say! The hike is around 4 miles round trip. The climb to the falls is uphill (kinda hard) and took me over an hour to get to the top, but it is well worth it! The falls are absolutely beautiful. I went in may and the water was flowing really hard! Ive been told its a lot calmer in the summer. If you haven’t already go on this hike! So so pretty

          <p>Rock canyon is very rocky, if you haven’t already inferred. Rock canyon has a lot of climbing routes for all skill levels.

            <p> This hike is perfect for any family! From kids to grandparents, there are always families having fun laughing! The hike is pretty short and has a lot of flat spots so its easy on the knees! There are usually a lot of people going on the weekend so if you have time in the evening on a week day, DO IT!! Very cool waterfall going into a little cave!

          <h3>Corner Canyon</h3>
          <p>Corner canyon is my favorite place to mountain bike! There are a lot of super fun trails with some big jumps! And there a trails that are easier for beginners! The climbs to the top aren’t too hard, and the downhill is an absolute blast! There is also a bike park that has beginner, intermediate, and pro jump lines and a pump track! So much fun!

          <h3>Butterfeild Canyon</h3>
          <p> Butterfield is a little canyon right next to the big copper mine in Herriman Utah. It is a very pretty drive up with lots of hammock spots on the side of the road. At the top of the canyon there is a small trail, and as you walk on the trail you will see a few abandoned cars that got pushed down the side of the mountain. Very cool stuff.
