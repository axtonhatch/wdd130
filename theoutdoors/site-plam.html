      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[for my final project in my HTML/CSS coding class I want to show people how enjoyable the outdoors are! (Mountain biking, rock climbing, hiking, etc…) I want to have specific places that I love and want to share! the website I want to make will have these things in it! I love the outdoors and spent most of my free time exploring all around Utah and other places I visit! Why should you go outdoors?? Because we live in a world with so much beauty that we won’t even get close to seeing it all, so you need to start now so you can take it all in! ]</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>[Places]</h3>
      <p>
        [Horse tail falls! Horse tail falls is a beautiful waterfall in Alpine Utah! The hike gives you a unique look at the provo valley, a rather pretty on if I do say! The hike is around 4 miles round trip. The climb to the falls is uphill (kinda hard) and took me over an hour to get to the top, but it is well worth it! The falls are absolutely beautiful. I went in may and the water was flowing really hard! Ive been told its a lot calmer in the summer. If you haven’t already go on this hike! So so pretty

        Rock canyon! Rock canyon is very rocky, if you haven’t already inferred. Rock canyon has a lot of climbing routes for all skill levels. There are always friendly people to talk to and make new friends. If your not into climbing there is also a trail that goes up the canyon! There are a few little caves on the way up, and it the top you have a wonderful view of provo!
        
        Donut falls! This hike is perfect for any family! From kids to grandparents, there are always families having fun laughing! The hike is pretty short and has a lot of flat spots so its easy on the knees! There are usually a lot of people going on the weekend so if you have time in the evening on a week day, DO IT!! Very cool waterfall going into a little cave!
        
        Corner canyon! Corner canyon is my favorite place to mountain bike! There are a lot of super fun trails with some big jumps! And there a trails that are easier for beginners! The climbs to the top aren’t too hard, and the downhill is an absolute blast! There is also a bike park that has beginner, intermediate, and pro jump lines and a pump track! So much fun!
        
        Butterfield canyon! Butterfield is a little canyon right next to the big copper mine in Herriman Utah. It is a very pretty drive up with lots of hammock spots on the side of the road. At the top of the canyon there is a small trail, and as you walk on the trail you will see a few abandoned cars that got pushed down the side of the mountain. Very cool stuff.

      <h3>[Questions]</h3>
      <p>
        [What shoes do you recommend for hiking? I personally love trail running shoes! Currently I use Hoka Speedgoat 4s! And they are amazing! Super cushy, they make me feel like i’m walking on a cloud! 

        What type of bike do you like better, hardtail or full suspension? I ride a full suspension bike! I can lock out my shocks so its easier on the climbs then unlock them for a nice smooth ride down! But they are more expensive. Hard tail bikes do allow you to climb easier but are not as cushy. 
        
        Why should I want to be outdoors? The outdoors is where you can feel one with gods creations. You are able to experience the beauty of this planet we live on. Your able to make memories with the people you love!
